**My personal blog**

My goal is to be able to make a blog where people can see how I elaborate my projects. Where I can explain and show step by step how I do them. 

I am developing it with `nextjs`, `mongodb`, `postgresql` and `express` for the API. Soon I will also use `prisma` for user authentication.
